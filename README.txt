Things to do:

- Makefile
- *.h + *.c
- Libs (folder)
- Maps (folder)
- Textures (folder)

MiniLibX - handles movement and drawing

Game has to have:

- WASD or Arrows movement
- Collectibles (get them all to unlock the exit)
- exit
- 2D view

The map has to:

- Be closed all the way around
- Have at least one:
	exit
	collectible
	player
- We should be able to use any map that abides by the rules

Graphic management:

- Closing, minimising, resizing, moving (etc), the window should be smooth
- ESC needs to close the window an quit the program
- Pressing the 'x' on the right corner should do the same as above
- Mandatory use of the images of  the MiniLibX
